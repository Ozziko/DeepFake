# DeepFake
A spare-time research project I started for my interest, challenge and experience - experimenting with auto-encoders, GANs, etc. to transfer gestures and maybe even voice between source and target videos.

## Project Roadmap
**(last update: 2019/10/15)**

1. (100%) developing a script to extract frames from a video.

2. (100%) developing a simple auto-encoder for images ([see notebook](https://github.com/Ozziko/DeepFake/blob/master/Image_autoencoder_basic.ipynb)).

3. (10%) developing a variational auto-encoder for images.

4. (10%) developing a GAN for images.

5. (0%) developing a visual DeepFake with crossed auto-encoders sharing the same encoder.

6. (0%) developing a visual DeepFake with crossed GAN-based auto-encoders.

7. (0%) developing a script to extract voice from a video.

8. (0%) developing a simple auto-encoder for voice.

9. (0%) developing a voice DeepFake with crossed auto-encoders sharing the same encoder.

10. (0%) combining everything, creating a complete DeepFake video.
